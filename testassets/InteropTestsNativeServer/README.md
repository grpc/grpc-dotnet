# Interop Tests Native Server

This project is a copy of [InteropServer.cs](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/912653e3ce504b9148409e577bc2028c4454d89c/src/csharp/Grpc.IntegrationTesting/InteropServer.cs) from https://github.com/grpc/grpc. The C# C Core native server is copied here to allow easier initial testing of the managed gRPC client against C Core. It could be removed from this repo in the future.

The authoritative copy of the interop tests is https://github.com/grpc/grpc. This copy may become out of date.
