# Experimental project

Grpc.AspNetCore.HealthChecks provides integration between [Health checks in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks) and the [Grpc.HealthCheck package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.HealthCheck).

This project is currently not published, but you can copy the code to use in your own applications. If a published package of Grpc.AspNetCore.HealthChecks would be useful for you, please give feedback at https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet/issues
